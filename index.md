## Welcome to my local project page!
### About Me:

I am a expierenced software developer who has worked with various data-based programs, and looking to branch out into data science. I have been in the software development field for 5 years.



### Project: DataSci Python
The DataSci Python Project is the capstone project built during the SNHU Computer Science program. In 6 weeks, I built a Python data mining program and a simple database from scratch. For this project, I used a sample school data showing student's GPA and teacher pay information. The data mining program uses 'modules' that I built to generate different graphs that show bar charts, Pie charts, and scatterplots. This module system can be improved upon to easily add in new data function for more complicated data mining.
